# The Solar System: An Interactive Project

An interactive project that displays information about celestial bodies in the solar system, including planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and galaxies. Fully developed from scratch, with a frontend in **React + TypeScript + Tailwind** and a backend in **Node.js + Express + TypeScript**.
I rebuilt this project, which I originally started in 2022, to enhance my skills in React, TypeScript, and full-stack development. I focused on creating a custom API, improving the design, and adding interactive animations to make the project more complete.
